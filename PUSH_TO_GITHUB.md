# Push to GitHub Guide

Your Ghostcleaner repository is ready! Here's how to push it to GitHub:

## 1. Create Repository on GitHub

Go to: https://github.com/new

- **Repository name**: `ghostcleaner`
- **Description**: `Smart cleanup tool for the AI-assisted development era - removes old versions while keeping the latest`
- **Public**: âœ“
- **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)

## 2. Push Your Code

After creating the empty repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/ghostcleaner

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ghostcleaner.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Create Release

```bash
# Tag the version
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release: Ghostcleaner v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 4. Update README URLs

Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username in:
- README.md
- README.ja.md
- All installation scripts

```bash
# Quick replace (macOS)
find . -type f -name "*.md" -o -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.rb" | xargs sed -i '' 's/yourusername/YOUR_ACTUAL_USERNAME/g'

# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update GitHub URLs"
git push
```

- `ai`
- `cleanup`
- `disk-space`
